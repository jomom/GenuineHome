# Complete Genuine Home starter project

After completion of Googles Angular codelab I was able to build GenuineHome.

The project involves creating a user interface using Angular.\
Using the Angular CLI, you created components and interfaces.\ 
Then, you using the powerful template features in Angular to build a functional app that displays images, handles events and more.\

What's next?
To continue to build functionality:

The data is hard-coded in the app. A great refactor is to add a service to contain the data.
The details page is currently displayed on the same page, but it would be cool to move the details to their own page and take advantage of Angular routing.
One other update would be to host the data at a rest endpoint and use the HTTP package in Angular to load the data at runtime.
Plenty of opportunities for fun.
